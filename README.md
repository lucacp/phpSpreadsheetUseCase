Use Case to PHP-Spreadsheet

First (1st): clone/Download code.
Second(2nd): composer update, to install "phpoffice/phpspreadsheet"
Third (3rd): Download Tabelas of the importers of the Brazil.
             The Downloaded files must be "Tabela $nameOfImporterCompany" and 
             ".xlsx" to not change the loader of file, example: "Tabela Magui.xlsx"
Fourth(4th): run "php .\index.php".


if the SpreadSheets change the columns style, 
change in the formatSheet.php the new configuration and 
run again the 4th step.

I used the spreadSheets of 
Magui Alimentos, Costa, JTC, Elmar, Leryc, Mundo Safra, Polico, Quinta Semente and R Moura.

Special Thanks to "Bedin Representações".

Errors: appears a lot of Warnings and some errors, but the files are generated in the "planilhas" folder.
